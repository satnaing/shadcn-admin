- The "Frontend" dir is a starter template repo for working with shadcn and vite, which we are going to be customizing to work with Swan, my SaaS app. Swan is an AI go-to-market engineer that builds agentic Sales workflows ontop of your CRM / other external signals and B2B data / research etc.
- We are working to migrate the capabilities in the root "agents" nextjs folder to this new "frontend" dir and repo.
