# Shadcn Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard UI crafted with Shadcn and Vite. Built with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.

I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.
