## GraphQl
- When creating operations.graphql files - they should live next to where they are being used in the "features" folder
- If you need to generate the types for an operations.graphql file - the commans is pnpm codegen

## General Rules
- When creating forms - use react-hook-form and the Forms components in components/ui/form
- For new pages, always wrap them in the <Page> component
- For loading state, aim to always use the <Loadable> component. Pass in a skeleton when it makes sense.
- Before implementing a feature, always check the src/components directory to see if there are available components ready to use to set up a page.
- When using toasts, import {toast} from 'sonner'
- Always strive to have a single component definition per file
