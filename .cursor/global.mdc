- This project uses pnpm, use that to run commands. It uses shadcn and tailwind.
- Before implementing a feature, always check the src/components directory to see if there are available components ready to use to set up a page.
- The "Frontend" dir is a starter template repo for working with shadcn and vite, which we are going to be customizing to work with Swan, my SaaS app. Swan is an AI go-to-market engineer that builds agentic Sales workflows ontop of your CRM / other external signals and B2B data / research etc.
- We are working to migrate the capabilities in the root "agents" nextjs folder to this new "frontend" dir and repo.
- When I ask to migrate something, it means from the "agents" nextjs project to the new "frontend" project
- When creating operations.graphql files - they should live next to where they are being used in the "features" folder
- When creating forms - use react-hook-form and the Forms components in components/ui/form
